//Factors

//Write a program that takes a number as input and prints all its factors. If the number has only two factors (1 and the number itself), then the program should print -1.
//Input Format :
//A single integer, n
//Output Format :
//All the factors of n excluding 1 and the number itself
//Constraints :
//0 <= n <= 10,000
//Sample Input 1 :
//8
//Sample Output 1 :
//2 4
//Sample Input 2 :
//11
//Sample Output 2 :
//-1
//Explanation of Sample Output 2 :
//11 is a prime number having factors 1 and 11 so that output will be -1.
